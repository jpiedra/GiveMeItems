GIVEMEITEMS V1 by JPZ - 8/24/2014

DESCRIPTION: 
	In-game mutator which causes monsters to drop inventory items 	
	specified by the user through a GUI window (also in-game).

FEATURES:
	-24 slots which the user can use to specify items to be dropped.

	-Choose how often items added through GiveMeItems are removed
		from the game.

	-Slots are filled in through GUI drop-down lists, which also
		double as text-entry fields.

	-Default Unreal Tournament inventory (weapons, health, etc.) 
		provided in drop down menus.

	-Recognizes custom packages inventory items, when a user enters
		the summon string in the text-entry fields (double-click
		the drop-down fields to enter text).

	-Custom package entries are saved for later use; no need to memorize,
		simply find them in the drop-down menus!	

	-Evaluation of user input; invalid or improperly spelled items
		are not added to the game.

	-Ammunition suggestion: When custom package weapons are detected,
		GiveMeItems will suggest the name of the ammo item used
		by such weapons.

	-Randomized default items: Randomly select default Unreal Tournament
		items for all slots on a page.

	-Clear Custom Entries: Unused custom entries can be cleared, if so
		desired.

INSTRUCTIONS:
	-Place the two files 'GiveMeItems.u' and 'GiveMeItems.int' into your
		'UnrealTournament\System' directory. 

	-Once you start your game, click the 'Mod' button on the top of the 
		Menu screen. In the list that appears, select 'GiveMeItems!!! Configuration'
		to select and enter items and settings.

	-To use the mutator in-game, click 'Mutators' and add "GiveMeItems!!!".

	-Gametypes which make use of monsters will now utilize the mutator. Enjoy!
