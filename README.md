This repository contains all files constituting the GiveMeItems mutators. 

You can also find previous versions of the project, under the "Previous Versions" folder. The format for each folder's name (month - day - year) describes the day on which changes made to the files found inside were saved. 

In the future, copies of the source code for these files will be shared, so that examination of the code comprising this project can be done without use of the UnrealScript IDE (UnrealEd).
